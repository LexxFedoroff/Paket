# What is Paket?

Paket is a dependency manager for .NET and mono projects, which is designed to work well with [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages and also enables [referencing files directly from GitHub repositories](http-dependencies.html).
It enables precise and predictable control over what packages the projects within your application reference. 

If you want to learn how to use Paket then read the ["Getting started" tutorial](getting-started.html) and take a look at the [FAQs](faq.html).

If you are already using NuGet for package management in your solution then you can learn about the upgrade process in the [convert from NuGet](getting-started.html#Automatic-NuGet-conversion) section.
